# Are We GUI Yet?

Want to find crates for GUI in Rust? Then you've come to the right place!


## Status

This site is maintained as best as possible. The next steps likely involve
replacing it with an automated system more like [lib.rs](https://lib.rs).

CI runs weekly to update crate information from crates.io, if it is not
overriden by the crate's configuration in this repo.


## What is this?

Companion website to
[arewegameyet](http://arewegameyet.com),
[arewewebyet](http://www.arewewebyet.org), and
[arewelearningyet](http://www.arewelearningyet.com).


## Contributing


### Submitting a crate

Add the crate to the `ecosystem.toml` file (using the keys documented
therein), and open a pull request.

For crates on crates.io, you should usually only include `name` and `tags`,
and leave all other fields blank. The remaining fields will be populated with
the crate's own defaults, which are written and updated by the crate
maintainers themselves. AWGY is rebuilt weekly to keep these fields (e.g.
`docs`, `repo`) up to date.

Your pull request will fail to build if `ecosystem.toml` includes these fields
with the same data as crates.io.

For projects/libraries/etc not on crates.io, or that are not well represented
by a single crate, you can provide all the fields, along with `skip-crates-io`
to prevent checking against crates.io.


### Submitting a news link

Add the post to the `newsfeed.toml` file, and open a pull request.


### Using the CLI

AreWeGuiYet uses Github Actions to build the site. The Github Action is
powered by a Rust CLI, which fetches the latest data for crates from
crates.io.

If you wish to build the site locally, you will need to run the CLI manually
with `cargo run -- publish`. The CLI maintains a cache so it doesn't hammer
any APIs with more calls than it needs to. If you downloaded the repo awhile
ago, please be sure to run with the `--clean` flag.

If you need assistance (or especially if there's a bug, of which there are
certainly many), please open an issue (it's much appreciated! ðŸ’–).


## Organization

The `docs` directory is the build directory for the HTML content. `docs` is committed to master
and is used as the web root for GitHub pages. Non-HTML files in the `docs` directory are anything
that the HTML pages depend on. Some of these are not generated and are hand written.

The `site` directory contains the Tera template files, which are used by the CLI to generate the
HTML in the `docs` directory.

The JS code on the main page is a little sloppy. If there are compatibility issues with your
browser please open an issue!

The `cli` directory contains the CLI tool which is used to create new entries on the website and
generate the HTML.


## TODO

Major undertakings remaining:
 - Crate search based on the tags and an optional query
 - tag commands
 - tag normalization
 - markdown sanitization, better sanitization in `.raw.html` files
 - Pull missing data from github and possibly other sites (bitbucket/gitlab?) if they have
  nice APIs!
    - The original author has no intention of implementing this but if you want a challenge this
        could be a fun project!
 - Do we want to support
    - listing Pros/Cons in addition to crate descriptions?
    - Screenshots?
 - Live badges for crate cards

And less major:
 - Move tag descriptions from title attribute into hover tooltip.
